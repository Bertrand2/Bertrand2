### Hi there ðŸ¤ 

I'm Bertrand, a 25 years old guy from Belgium curious about the world who likes to learn and help others. I started programming because I felt it could be a game-changer in the educational system, but it is still not well-used. My main focuses are a greener, more accessible, open source, privacy-oriented web and better ways to learn.

I currently work at Odoo.

I have interests in a lot of stuff, such as are environment, nature, scouts, science and mathematics, game design,â€¦ and am always open to discover something new.

Here are some random fun stuff I made :
* [Minesweeper !](https://bertrand2.github.io/minesweeper/) ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/minesweeper))
* [A npm package that lets you know when you can **not** work](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sylber/holidates-cli) ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/holidates-npm-package))
* [Pomodoro timer](https://retromodoro.netlify.app/) made with React ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/first-react-app))
* [Small UX designs inspired from Dribbble](https://bertrand2.github.io/dribble-challenge/) ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/dribble-challenge))

I also contributed to those projects :
* A forum website made using PHP ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/Badminton-Club-Bain-de-Bretagne))
* A website designed for a restaurant made with a custom wordpress theme ([repo](https://github.com/Bertrand2/ChaosCoffeeRestaurant))
* A tree buying game using node.js & react ([repo](https://github.com/bastlaf/Mwenbwa))

â€¦and some [presentations](https://github.com/Bertrand2/becode-watch) I made for BeCode, a belgian training for web development.
